## Rationale

### Plug & Play setup

Getting your database stack setup in Clojure can be a bit of a chore. It can be
daunting for new Clojurians (and especially those that have never used
Java). The Clojure community tends to lean towards the "pick the libraries that
you need" method rather than using a "framework" when building an
application. Which just makes it more challenging for new users. Once you're
familiar with the Clojure ecosystem you'll know which libraries you prefer and
create your own setup. And that's exactly what I've done.

If you want complete control over your database stack, then this is probably not
for you. If you're a beginner and are overwhelmed with all the necessary
libraries and configuration, if you're looking for a Clojure database library
that aims to provide a quality of life experience similar to Ruby's ActiveRecord
or Elixir's Ecto, then stick around.

### Data Driven

I cannot stress this enough, I really dislike macros. Clojure and a large part
of its community have taught me the beauty of writing data driven code. With
libraries such as HoneySQL, Hiccup, Integrant, Reitit, Malli, I think this is
the Golden age of Data Driven Clojure. I never want to see macros in my API
again.

## Features

### Plug & Playâ„¢

Include Gungnir in your project, and off you go! Gungnir includes (almost)
everything you need for your app.

* [next-jdbc](https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc)
* [hikari-cp](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP)
* [HoneySQL](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql)
* [Malli](https://github.com/metosin/malli)
* TODO - Create a data driven migration library

### Models

Define models to map your Clojure data to SQL. Gungnir uses models to provides
seamless translation between Clojure and SQL.

### Changesets

Inspired by Elixir Ecto's Changesets. These are used for validating your data
before creating and updating it in the database.

### Querying & Extension to HoneySQL

Gungnir isn't here to reinvent the wheel. Even though we have an interface for
querying the database, we can still make use of HoneySQL syntax. This allows us
to expand our queries, or write more complex ones for the edge cases.

### Relational mapping

Relations are easily accessed with Gungnir. Records with relations will have
access to `relational atoms` which can be dereffed to query any related rows.
